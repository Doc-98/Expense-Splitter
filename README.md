# 🛒 Expense Splitter  

Have you ever found yourself painstakingly dividing each item in a receipt between the people of your household? Because me and my friends have.
I know this is probably an issue more prominent in students that live together and go grocery shopping together, but no one is stopping you from using this when you go on a trip or any kind of vacation and maybe someone picks up a tab for everyone, just to speed things up, with the intention to split the tab later.

Whichever the case, this program is thought with the primary intention to speed that process along and automate it as much as I can.

## 📌 Overview  
This repository serves multiple purposes:  
- It helps me learn more about Git by actively using it.  
- It allows me to track my progress and continuously work on this project.  
- It functions as a cloud storage to switch between my main computer and laptop.  
- It makes sharing my project easier with friends or online when I need help with an issue.  

## 💡 Project Description  
**Expense Splitter** is an application designed to help students or shared households fairly divide expenses when buying groceries together. While many apps track who paid what, this application focuses on **dividing items on a receipt before tracking payments**.  

### ✨ Key Features  
✔️ Open text or PDF files containing a receipt from supported stores.  
✔️ Add items to the expense list manually.  
✔️ Specify who purchased each item.  
✔️ Automatically calculate how much each person owes based on their selected items.  

## 🛠 Installation Instructions  
The application is intended to be packaged using **JLink**, but currently, there's an issue with a newly added library for handling PDFs, as it is not modular. This prevents JLink from creating the package. I am working on resolving this issue.  

For now, the application can be run directly from the source code using **JavaFX**.  

## 🚀 Usage Example  
1. Load a **supported receipt** in text or PDF format into the application.  
2. Manually **add any missing items or extra expenses**.  
3. Assign **buyers** to each item in the list.  
4. Click a button to **calculate how much each person owes**.  

## 🤝 Contributing  
Contributions are welcome! 🎉  
- Feel free to **submit issues** on GitHub.  
- The repository is **public**, so anyone can **clone** it and work on it independently.  

## 📌 Kanban Board  
I use a Kanban board to better organize the project’s workflow. You can check out the board [here](https://trello.com/invite/b/67d360cb6ec6615a3c5111c9/ATTIc5b4edf112045cc09c717aa17af7c4a803A0620B/ripartizione-spesa).
